        Programming language
        A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.
        Most programming languages are text-based formal languages,
        but they may also be graphical. They are a kind of computer language.
        The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and
        semantics (meaning),
        which are usually defined by a formal language. Some languages are defined by a specification document (for
        example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a
        dominant implementation that is treated as a reference.
        Some languages have both,
        with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being
        common.
